# PROJECT: DESIGN TEARDOWN

This is the fifth project of the Main HTML/CSS curriculum at [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) - @microverseinc
* The objective is to create a grayscale visual hierarchy [website]

"Visual hierarchy suggests there is a proper way to view content visually: in a hierarchical way. In other words, there is a pecking order to things‚Ä¶some content should be viewed first, some second, some third, and on down the line. The most important content is at the top of the hierarchy. It‚Äôs the visual element you look at first, which then directs you to what to look at next. Just like a great writer starts with a interesting lead that sends you breathlessly into the next paragraph, a thoughtful designer will efficiently move the viewer from one piece of content to the next. "
